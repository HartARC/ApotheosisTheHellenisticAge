# TO-DO: Move effects to a notification event, which would also let the player refound either Astakos or Chalkedon as the kingdom's capital. Additional effects:
# - The new capital gains a modifier similar to those from the "Found the Capital of the Rus'" event; we may want to include a development growth modifier rather than having it immediately increase by an arbitrary amount
# - +100 control in Realm Capital
# - New capital becomes de jure capital of k_bithynia
# - If clan, adopts feudal government
# - Tribal vassals adopt clan government
# - (Possibly exceassive) Bithynian culture gains the Monetary Standards and Bureaucracy innovations
# - (Probably excessive) Character gains philhellene modifier, boosting their relationship with Greek characters as long as their culture is non-Greek (is this even possible?) - in the future it may be worth looking into whether a similar modifier could be applied to dynasties that became considerably Hellenised, though this should be invalidated for characters who adopt Greek culture. The ideal ultimately would be to have this work dynamically with any culture to reflect peer polity interaction
