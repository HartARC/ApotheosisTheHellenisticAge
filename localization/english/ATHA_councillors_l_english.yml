He is eligible to be elected as the main Spartan king and has council tasks that represents his role in history.\n\n#F The [city_state|E] of Sparta had an unusual constitution that set it apart from other states of its time. Most notably, it was ruled by two kings, though their duties were primarily religious and militaristic by the 3rd century BC. They were expected to lead the Spartan army in the field, made religious offerings and consulted the Oracle of Delphi. The kings' power was small compared to the five Ephors, who were elected for a single year. The Ephors were the ambassadors of Sparta, oversaw campaigns led by the kings and declared war on the Helot slave population each autumn.#!"
