  ATHA_government.0001.t:0 "A Servant No More"
  ATHA_government.0001.desc:0 "Once upon a time I was a mere cog in the bureaucratic machine, bound by the rules and dictations of my superiors. Oh, how things have changed! No longer awaiting dispatches or demands, I can go about my daily business content in the knowledge that I answer to no one. The people of [ROOT.Char.GetPrimaryTitle.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] recognise this too, and are beginning to call me the #EMP [ROOT.Char.GetTitleTierName]#! of this land."
  ATHA_government.0001.desc_count:0 "\n\nI must not be complacent however. If I die before I have truly consolidated myself as a dynast, it is likely the people won't be quite so generous to my successor, who may be forced to work within the framework of City-State governance."
  ATHA_government.0001.desc_duke:0 "\n\nAlthough my position is secure for the moment, I and my descendants must remain vigilant: if we lose too much of our power and territory, we may be forced to work within the framework of City-State governance."
  ATHA_government.0001.a:0 "The future is looking bright."
  ATHA_government.0001.a_count:0 "There is much to be done."
  ATHA_government.0001.a_duke:0 "Everything is coming along nicely."
  ATHA_government.0001.a.tt:0 "If I do not hold a [duchy|E] or higher-tier title by the time of my death, and if my [realm_capital|E] remains a [castle|E], my heir will be forced to adopt a [city_state|E] [government_form|E]."
  ATHA_government.0001.b:0 "Mind you, City-State governance does sound intriguing..."

  ATHA_government.city_state_select.tt:0 "I will get to decide what sort of [city_state|E] [government|E] I wish to establish—a [city_state_democracy|E], [city_state_oligarchy|E], [city_state_aristocracy|E] or [city_state_tyranny|E]."

  ATHA_government.0002.t:0 "The City Awakens" 
  ATHA_government.0002.desc:0 "With the passing of my [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMe', SCOPE.sC('previous_holder'))] [previous_holder.GetTitledFirstName], the people of [ROOT.Char.GetPrimaryTitle.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] are calling for change. I hear some now call me a petty tyrant, or even demand that I be held accountable to #EMP them#!. Worst of all, the view that I am no more than the head of a lowly City-State is rapidly gaining momentum." 
  ATHA_government.0002.desc_b:0 "\n\nIt is clear that if I want to survive, I'll need to start acting as a citizen and not a #EMP [ROOT.Char.GetTitleTierName]#!. A choice however remains: what form should my new government take? Naturally, I remain a leading figure whatever my decision, but with diminished powers, or popularity, depending on my path..." 
  ATHA_government.0002.desc_intelligent:0 "\n\nIt doesn't matter what they say though, for I can prove them all wrong. I have the skills and ambition to guide the [ROOT.Char.GetPrimaryTitle.GetNameNoTooltip] to new heights, and it won't take long for me to demonstrate this to the people and convince them that I truly am their #EMP [ROOT.Char.GetTitleTierName]#!." 
  ATHA_government.0002.a:0 "The less that changes, the better." 
  ATHA_government.0002.a_deceitful:0 "Calling it a "Democracy" is surely enough, no?"  
  ATHA_government.0002.a_deceitful.flavor:0 "People truly are gullible—all I have to do is convince them that I am acting in their interests and they'll tolerate almost anything." 
  ATHA_government.0002.b:0 "I suppose I could share power with a #EMP few#! people..." 
  ATHA_government.0002.c:0 "How about a healthy compromise with the rich?" 
  ATHA_government.0002.d:0 "I think it's time to return power to the people."
  ATHA_government.0002.e:0 "That being said, I actually agree with them."
  ATHA_government.0002.intelligent_a:0 "I'm only just getting started."
  ATHA_government.0002.intelligent_a.tt:0 "Due to my ambition and intellect, I am allowed to preserve my [feudal|E] [government|E]. However, if I do not hold a [duchy|E] or higher-tier title by the time of my death, and if my [realm_capital|E] remains a [castle|E], my heir will likely not receive the same accommodations."
  ATHA_government.0002.intelligent_b:0 "That being said, maybe they have a point."

  ATHA_government.0003.t:0 "The Constitution" 
  ATHA_government.0003.desc:0 "My advisors were certainly taken aback by my wish to draft a new constitution to govern the people of [ROOT.Char.GetPrimaryTitle.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip]. Doing this, they warned, would open up my every decision to scrutiny and expose me to a whole raft of new issues characteristic of City-State politics.\n\nIn any case, if I decide to press forward with this constitution, there is an important question I will need to address: what form of government do I want to adopt for my City-State?" 
  ATHA_government.0003.a:0 "I suppose I'm already a Tyrant in all but name." 
  ATHA_government.0003.a_deceitful:0 "If I make the people #EMP think#! they have power..." 
  ATHA_government.0003.a_deceitful.flavor:0 "People truly are gullible—all I have to do is convince them that I am acting in their interests and they'll tolerate almost anything." 
  ATHA_government.0003.b:0 "It wouldn't hurt to have the Aristocracy on my side." 
  ATHA_government.0003.c:0 "An Oligarchy would balance things quite nicely, I think." 
  ATHA_government.0003.d:0 "Genuine Democracy is the best way forward." 
  ATHA_government.0003.e:0 "Maybe this isn't such a great idea after all..." 
  ATHA_government.0003.e.tt:0 "My government will remain [feudal|E] for the time being."
