  city_state_emergency.0001.desc:0 "'The tip is blunt and rusty. With this spear you will dissapoint our city in battle' I said as I was inspecting the men. As marshal I always meet with small groups of citizens to check our war readiness. By the end of the afternoon, I noticed a ruckus at a nearby inn and walked over to see what was happening. I saw a group of mercenaries whom we recently hired to aid in our wars. One [mutiny_ringleader.GetWomanMan] stood out among the group: [mutiny_ringleader.GetFirstName]. [mutiny_ringleader.GetSheHe|U] is a captain among one of the mercenary companies. I stayed out of sight and listened carefully...\n\nThe mercenaries loudly complained about their delayed wages and the lack of combat; combat that would have allowed them to pillage enemy settlements. The sound levels and redness in their faces quickly escalated as they voiced all of their grievances. All the while [mutiny_ringleader.GetFirstName] silently listened. Finally [mutiny_ringleader.GetSheHe] spoke up: 'It is as clear to me as it is to all of you that [ROOT.Char.GetLiege.GetTitledFirstName] has breached our contract by forsaking our wages. Worry not, men, I have heard your worries among many of the other men. I just have to talk to a few other comrades and we will give [ROOT.Char.GetLiege.GetFirstName] the treatment he deserves.'"

[mutiny_reporter.GetHerHis] report greatly disturbed me.\n\n[mutiny_reporter.GetFirstName] described listening in on a heated conversation between some of the mercenary forces. They are very unhappy about the lack of payments owing to our empty treasury. An ambitious mercenary captain called [mutiny_ringleader.GetFirstName] seems to be organizing a mutiny among our angry mercenaries.\n\nThis needs to be dealt with immediately as these mercenaries pose an existential threat to all of our lives!"

  city_state_emergency.0005.desc:0 "The temple was quiet. Few people visited the temple at those hours as they made themselves busy during the day. As such, I saw an opportunity to take from the temple treasury to give to [ROOT.Char.GetLiege.GetTitledFirstName]. The treasury of the temple is vast, filled with sacrifices and donations since time immemorial. Much of the treasure had been filed and organised so that missing treasure would surely be noticed by other priests and temple servants. That is why I looked at the piles of unorganised treasure, mostly made up of trinkets and non-monetary goods. A gold necklace studded with wonderful blue stones instantly caught my eyes.\n\nAs I was on my way to [ROOT.Char.GetLiege.GetFirstName]'s residence while carrying the necklace and a few other trinkets, I was pushed to the floor from behind. My assailant brutally attacked and punched me before he was removed by the mob. \"That's my wife's. [ROOT.Char.GetSheHe|U]'s stolen it!\", he exclaimed while pointing towards the necklace. \"The people will hear of this!\"."

[court_chaplain.GetSheHe|U] took a distinctive necklace with Lapis Lazuli embedded in its pendant from the temple treasury. [court_chaplain.GetSheHe|U] aimed to pawn off this necklace and deliver the funds to me in order to pay off the mercenaries. A citizen recognised the necklace and attacked [court_chaplain.GetHerHim] in the streets outside my residence! [court_chaplain.GetFirstName] came to me immediately afterward.\n\nThis citizen is certainly already spreading the word on our necessary appropriation of temple treasure and soon my political opponents will hear.
