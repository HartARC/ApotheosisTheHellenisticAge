  city_state_emergency.0001.desc:0 "'The tip is blunt and rusty. With this spear you will dissapoint our city in battle' I said as I was inspecting the men. As marshal I always meet with small groups of citizens to check our war readiness. By the end of the afternoon, I noticed a ruckus at a nearby inn and walked over to see what was happening. I saw a group of mercenaries whom we recently hired to aid in our wars. One [mutiny_ringleader.GetWomanMan] stood out among the group: [mutiny_ringleader.GetFirstName]. [mutiny_ringleader.GetSheHe|U] is a captain among one of the mercenary companies. I stayed out of sight and listened carefully...\n\nThe mercenaries loudly complained about their delayed wages and the lack of combat; combat that would have allowed them to pillage enemy settlements. The sound levels and redness in their faces quickly escalated as they voiced all of their grievances. All the while [mutiny_ringleader.GetFirstName] silently listened. Finally [mutiny_ringleader.GetSheHe] spoke up: 'It is as clear to me as it is to all of you that [ROOT.Char.GetLiege.GetTitledFirstName] has breached our contract by forsaking our wages. Worry not, men, I have heard your worries among many of the other men. I just have to talk to a few other comrades and we will give [ROOT.Char.GetLiege.GetFirstName] the treatment he deserves.'"

  city_state_emergency.0002.desc:0 "I was reading some of my letters and notes as my [mutiny_reporter.GetCouncilTitle] [mutiny_reporter.GetFirstName] rushed into my chambers. [mutiny_reporter.GetHerHis] report greatly disturbed me.\n\n[mutiny_reporter.GetFirstName] described listening in on a heated conversation between some of the mercenary forces. They are very unhappy about the lack of payments owing to our empty treasury. An ambitious mercenary captain called [mutiny_ringleader.GetFirstName] seems to be organizing a mutiny among our angry mercenaries.\n\nThis needs to be dealt with immediately as these mercenaries pose an existential threat to all of our lives!"
