  greece_decisions.0001.desc:0 "The years following the $battle_leuktra$ were marked by defeat after humiliating defeat. Those painful years saw us become a mere backwater: unworthy of conquest, we were an embarrassment to our forefathers and an insult to their proud deeds.\n\nBut thankfully, that is all in the past—under my guidance, the Lakedaimonians have clawed their way back from the brink and now stand on the precipice of greatness. With [messenia.GetNameNoTier] under our rightful control and the Arkadian threat reduced, we are in a strong position to re-establish [ROOT.Char.GetPrimaryTitle.GetNameNoTier] as the #EMP hēgemōn#! of all free Greeks." 
  greece_decisions.0001.a:0 "As for the [messenia.GetAdjectiveNoTooltip]s, they must pay for their insolence." 
  greece_decisions.0001.a.tt:0 "The people of [messenia.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] will be enslaved!" 
  greece_decisions.0001.b:0 "We shall be gracious in victory." 
  greece_decisions.0001.b.tt:0 "The people of [messenia.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] will be granted #EMP períoikoi#! status." 

  greece_decisions.0002.t:0 "A Resurgent [k_lakedaimon_founder.GetPrimaryTitle.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip]?" 
  greece_decisions.0002.desc:0 "For many years, the [k_lakedaimon_founder.GetPrimaryTitle.GetName] has been in a position of relative weakness, the glory days of Thermopýlai long past. Now, however, [k_lakedaimon_founder.GetTitledFirstName] has been able to restore much of [k_lakedaimon_founder.GetHerHis] country's former strength, and seems poised to become a dominant player in the affairs of $k_hellas$." 
  greece_decisions.0002.desc_a:0 "\n\nThe first act of this resurgent state has been to enslave the people of [messenia.GetNameNoTier], who had traditionally been under the Spartan thumb as #EMP Heílōtes#!. Indeed, it seems that [k_lakedaimon_founder.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] is seeking to take things back to how they were, and [k_lakedaimon_founder.GetHerHis] hegemonic ambitions certainly offer reason for lesser realms to be concerned." 
  greece_decisions.0002.desc_b:0 "\n\nIn an unusual display of magnanimity, the Spartans have granted the people of [messenia.GetNameNoTier] the status of #EMP períoikoi#!, guaranteeing them some degree of individual freedom. This is certainly a stunning contrast to the brutal servitude they once endured under [k_lakedaimon_founder.GetPrimaryTitle.GetAdjectiveNoTooltip] rule, and is perhaps a sign that [k_lakedaimon_founder.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] seeks to lead [k_lakedaimon_founder.GetHerHis] realm down a new path." 
  greece_decisions.0002.a:0 "An interesting development..." 
  greece_decisions.0002.a_pythian:0 "This cruelty must not go unpunished!" 
  greece_decisions.0002.b:0 "It seems we are dealing with a milder Sparta, at least."
