  game_concept_debate_desc:0 "A Debate is a discussion on a particular topic using arguments to argue for a certain viewpoint. The purpose of a debate is to convince the public of the viewpoint that you are arguing for.\n\nWithin democratic elective titles, [characters|E] can use the "Prepare Debate" scheme against electors, candidates or the holder of the title to initiate debate preparations. This will allow them to choose a number of arguments that are appropriate to the current situation. After specifying the arguments, the character will prepare the debate until the scheme completes.\n\nIf the chosen arguments match up to current circumstances, the character is more likely to win a debate. Traits like [GetTrait('stuttering').GetName( GetNullCharacter )], [GetTrait('gregarious').GetName( GetNullCharacter )] or [GetTrait('shy').GetName( GetNullCharacter )] can also affect the chance of winning a debate. After finishing the debate, the debate target will be offered the chance to make a rebuttal. If he makes a strong defense, the debate victory may be nullified."
