Kings and their relatives would be bestowed with the title of 'Sōtēr' or Saviour. In one instance, King Antigonos Monophthalmos and his son Demetrios were recognised as such in Athens accompanied with a festival and altar to honor their liberation of the city.\nThe influence of Soterism was felt much more profoundly in the eastern Greek realms than in mainland Greece or the western Greek colonies. Influenced by Persian and Egyptian traditions, Seleukid and Ptolemaic kings supported the proliferation of ruler cults within their realms and appointed relatives or favourites as priests within the cult.#!"
